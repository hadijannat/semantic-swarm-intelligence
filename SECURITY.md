# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support security fixes for the latest release on the `main` branch and the two most recent tagged releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to: **security@hadijannat.com**.

Include as much detail as possible:
- Affected version or commit
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a timeline for remediation.

## Responsible Disclosure for Industrial/ICS Environments

This project targets industrial connectivity workflows. Do **not** publish exploit details, default credential lists, or operational parameters in public issues. Use the private reporting channel above.

## Security Considerations

- The system is designed to be **read-only by default** for NOA-aligned deployments.
- Enable any write-back features only with explicit, documented operational approval.
